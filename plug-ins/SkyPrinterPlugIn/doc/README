The SkyPrinterPlugin is a simple print plugin for OpenJUMP. The original source
code is by Larry Becker. Michaël Michaud have made the first port to OpenJUMP.
Tkanks to Larry and Michaël!

This code is a simple ant project. You can build, run and jar it with ant. If
you prefer an IDE for developement you can do this. In NetBeans you have to
define a "Java Free-Form Project". The NetBeans project directory should not be
the same as the SkyPrinterPlugin was checked out. You can check out the code to
SkyPrinterPlugin and save the NetBeans project to SkyPrinterPlugin_NB for
example.
In Eclipse this should be similar ;-)

There are the following ant targets:
clean: make a cleanup (runs befor build)
build: compile the code to target/classes
run: runs OpenJUMP with the plugin
jar: build a JAR file for distribution

To compile and run this code you need some libs from OpenJUMP and the OpenJUMP
classes himself. The location of this is defined in the build.propertis file.
In the normal case you have only to set up the "openjump.svn" property to the
location of the OpenJUMP libs and code. This can simply be done on ant command
line:
    ant -Dopenjump.svn=your_very_special_openjump_SVN_path run

If you do not have checked out the OpenJUMP source code for some reasons, you
have to take care, that in the "openjump.svn" directory a "lib" subdirectory
available is. In this "lib" directory you need the OpenJUMP JAR file and all the
additional JAR's. You can simply set "openjump.svn" to your OpenJUMP
Installation directory. But be aware, you need a OpenJUMP version which was
released after 15.06.2013! To run the SkyPrinterPlugin with OpenJUMP 1.6.3 is
impossible!

During developement the SkyPrinterPlugin is loaded via the <extension ...>
in workbench-properties.xml. So the -properties workbench-properties.xml
parameter is mandatory. This is done through ant.
In a normal deployment you have simply place the JAR into the lib/ext directory.
The JAR is created in the target subdirectory.
